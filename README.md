# Graph Analyzer

**Graph Analyzer** is an interactive playground designed for exploring, creating, and analyzing graphs on a dynamic canvas. This tool allows users to visualize and master graph algorithms through customizable options and animations, making it ideal for learning and experimentation.


## What's Graph Analyzer All About?

- **Interactive Playground**: Dive into a dynamic canvas where you can create, edit, and experiment with graphs like never before.
- **Algorithm Showtime**: Curious about how algorithms like BFS, DFS, or Dijkstra's work? Watch them in action with easy-to-understand, visually engaging animations.
- **Analyze & Personalize**: Customize your graphs, tweak algorithm settings, and adjust the learning pace to match your style.

## Key Features

- **Vertex and Edge Customization**: 
  - Add, edit, and delete vertices with unique names.
  - Specify edges with source, destination, and optional weight.
  - Support for both weighted and unweighted graphs with automatic weight calculations based on edge lengths.
  - Toggle between Directed and Undirected graph types.

- **Algorithm Visualization**:
  - Perform various graph algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS), cycle detection, minimum spanning tree (Prim's), and shortest path.
  - Watch step-by-step animations that guide you through each algorithmâ€™s process.

- **Animation Controls**:
  - Adjust the delay time between steps to track each part of the algorithm more carefully.
  - Visualize complex graph structures at your own pace, with delay options ranging from 0.2 to 5 seconds.

- **Graph Management Options**:
  - Instantly clear all vertices and edges with the reset function.
  - Build a graph manually by inputting the number of vertices and edges, with detailed edge connections.

## Instructions

### Left Menu

The **Left Menu** provides essential controls for creating and editing vertices and edges.

- **Vertex**:
  - Add vertices with unique, case-sensitive names.
  - Delete a vertex to remove it along with all associated edges.

- **Edge**:
  - Add edges by specifying source, destination, and an optional weight.
  - Delete edges to modify the graph structure dynamically.

- **Weight**:
  - Weight is calculated based on the distance between vertices by default.
  - Adjust the weight scale using a slider to emphasize or de-emphasize edge weights visually.

### Right Menu

The **Right Menu** provides controls for visualizing algorithms, adjusting animations, and resetting or building graphs.

- **Visualize**:
  - Select an algorithm from the dropdown and click the "Visualize" button to start an animated walkthrough of the algorithm.
  - Visual animations guide you through each step, making the learning process intuitive and engaging.

- **Step Delay**:
  - Use the slider above the "Visualize" button to set the delay time between steps, which helps in tracking each phase of the algorithm closely.

- **Reset Graph**:
  - Clear all vertices and edges from the graph to start fresh.

- **Build from Input**:
  - Create a graph by providing details like the number of vertices, edges, and individual edge connections.

### Additional Controls

- **Vertex Size Adjustment**: Adjust vertex size using a slider in the left menu.
- **Weight Scale Adjustment**: Scale edge weights using a dedicated slider.
- **Graph Type Toggles**: Switch between **Directed/Undirected** and **Weighted/Unweighted** modes for a more flexible graph experience.
